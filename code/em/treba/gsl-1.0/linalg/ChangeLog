	* test_la.c (main): added tests for SV decomposition and solve.

 	functions, tidied up the algorithm a bit. Use a standard tolerance
 	of 10*GSL_DBL_EPSILON.
	(gsl_linalg_SV_solve): added a least squares solver

Sun Apr 23 21:18:04 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

Sat Mar 11 17:36:33 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* multiply.c: removed _impl from these functions since all the
 	errors they can return are fatal.

Wed Feb 16 12:03:00 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* multiply.c (gsl_la_matmult_mod_impl): fixed error in transposed
 	matrix memory access, expressions should always be of the form
	M->data[i*M->size2 + j] even when i,j are transposed.

	Safer to replace matrix access by gsl_matrix_set and
 	gsl_matrix_get, which is what I have done now. Shouldn't be any
 	cost in the production version of the library where we have
 	inlines and range checking off.

Tue Feb 15 17:46:19 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* tridiag.h (solve_cyc_tridiag): fixed typo in header, was

 	gsl_vector_int

 	organization
