	* test.c (main): added extra nist tests

	* lmutil.c (compute_rptdx): fixed bug, permutation in rptdx vector
 	 was incorrectly applied

	* lmpar.c (compute_newton_direction): fixed bug, permutation of
 	newton direction vector was incorrect (should have been inverse
 	permutation)

Mon Jul 30 17:43:21 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test_filip.c (test_filip): reduce tolerance on covariance test
 	slightly for MSVC with /O2

Sun Jul  1 22:42:34 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* multilinear.c:  modified to use new-style vector views

	* test_pontius.c:  modified to use new-style vector views

	* test_longley.c:  modified to use new-style vector views

	* test_fn.c:  modified to use new-style vector views

	* test_filip.c:  modified to use new-style vector views

Tue Jun 26 21:41:30 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test_filip.c (test_filip): reduce tolerance on covariance test
 	slightly

Wed Jun 20 13:11:26 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* removed unused variable work2

Tue Jun 19 23:18:01 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* multilinear.c: perform column scaling before doing fit to
 	improve accuracy
	(gsl_multifit_linear): use modified Golub-Reinsch SVD for greater
 	speed
	(gsl_multifit_wlinear): use modified Golub-Reinsch SVD for greater
 	speed

Wed Jun  6 13:32:22 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* lmder.c covar.c lmiterate.c lmset.c: updated to use new QR
 	calling convention (now passes workspace)

Sat Apr 28 11:46:59 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* qrsolv.c (qrsolv): removed local declaration of j to avoid
 	shadowing global j

Mon Apr 23 13:40:04 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* qrsolv.c (qrsolv): made function static so it is not exported

Wed Apr 18 13:39:33 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* lmpar.c (compute_newton_direction): moved final rescaling inside
 	loop, as in the original lmpar.f

Thu Mar  8 15:29:32 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* lmpar.c (compute_newton_direction): corrected bug that produced
 	negative index

Sun Feb 18 16:39:46 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* fdfsolver.c (gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_alloc): changed so that the
 	solver _alloc function no longer calls _set, the user must do that
 	separately.

Fri Sep 29 19:19:24 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* Makefile.am multifit/demo.c: removed demo from Makefile since it
 	is was just a temporary test.
