	* cheb_eval.c (cheb_eval_e): keep track of cancellation error to
 	prevent underestimates of total error.

Fri Oct 12 16:39:27 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test_hyperg.c (test_hyperg): increased tolerance from TOL0 to

Wed Aug  8 19:55:34 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test_sf.c (test_coupling): used analytic expressions for the
 	exact values to problems with insufficient precision

Thu Jul 12 15:25:04 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test_legendre.c (test_legendre): corrected tests to use exact
	floating point arguments near singularities.

	* legendre_Qn.c (gsl_sf_legendre_Q0_e): removed unnecessary error
 	terms that I added

Wed Jul 11 16:06:45 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* error.h: moved domain, overflow and underflow errors into
 	macros, return Nan for domain error, Inf for overflow.

Tue Jul 10 22:00:55 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* erfc.c (gsl_sf_log_erfc_e): introduce an additional log(erfc)
 	branch to prevent loss of accuracy for small x

	* test_sf.c (test_zeta): increased tolerance on zeta function test
 	to take into account differences in rounding

2001-07-10  Brian Gough  <bjg@hppav.local>

	* zeta.c (riemann_zeta1m_slt0): added a function to compute
 	zeta(1-s) without loss of accuracy for s near zero, as used by the
 	reflection formula.  This fixes a bug in the accuracy of results
 	of zeta(-x) for small x, where loss of precision previously
 	occurred by evaluating 1-x.

2001-07-06  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* erfc.c (gsl_sf_erfc_e): corrected case of -10<x<-5 to take into

Tue Jul  3 12:09:33 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* eval.h (EVAL_DOUBLE): avoid returning the status value as a
 	numerical result

2001-06-28  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* elementary.c (gsl_sf_multiply_e): use GSL_COERCE_DBL macro to
	deal with extended register problem

	* coupling.c: include stdlib.h for prototype of abs()

Wed Jun 27 21:20:22 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test_sf.c (test_fermidirac): increased tolerance on test of
 	gsl_sf_fermi_dirac_int(9,500) by factor of two to allow for MSVC

Tue Jun 26 12:10:17 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

 	definition

Sun May  6 13:01:01 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test_sf.c: initialize message_buff to null string to prevent
 	random segmentation faults

Mon Apr 30 12:38:15 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* airy_zero.c bessel_zero.c: zeros are now counted using an
 	unsigned int

	* poly.c: moved poly_eval function into poly/ directory

Wed Apr 25 17:28:48 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* trig.c (gsl_sf_polar_to_rect): dropped _e from polar/rect
 	conversion functions

Tue Apr 24 17:05:22 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* split out chebyshev functions into their own cheb/ directory,
 	leaving behind an internal cheb struct and cheb evaluation
 	function.

Mon Apr 23 10:21:06 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* changed tests for EFAULT into a commented-out macro, since
 	EFAULT should only apply to invalid non-null pointers, but it
 	might be useful to keep the tests around for debugging in this
 	directory.

	* unified error handling conventions to _e for error handling
 	functions and no suffix for plain functions, so _impl functions
 	are no longer needed.

1999-08-02  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@lanl.gov>

	* fermi_dirac.c: took out the use of some "const int" constants
	which were being used to size arrays, since this is not portable
	(thanks to Bernd Petrovitsch <bernd@ict.tuwien.ac.at> for pointing
	this out).

1999-01-02  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* trig.c (gsl_sf_rect_to_polar_impl): introduced an #ifdef
	HAVE_HYPOT for systems that do not have the hypot() routine.

Sun Feb 14 20:59:50 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@netsci.freeserve.co.uk>

	* Makefile.am (include_HEADERS): added gsl_sf_result.h

1998-12-05  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.am: t-erf.c was commented out, which is a problem
	(pointed out by automake-1.3b).  Moved the commented-out t-erf.c
	line to the end of the long list of files.

	* legendre_poly.c (gsl_sf_legendre_Pl_impl):
	* legendre_con.c (gsl_sf_conicalP_xgt1_neg_mu_largetau_impl):
	added an ugly fix to the invocation of gsl_sf_bessel_Jn_impl() to
	give it two bogus arguments so that it builds.  I hope Jerry fixes
	it up soon!

	* gsl_sf_airy.h: added an include of gsl_precision.h so that
	gsl_prec_t is defined.

Tue Nov 17 17:29:31 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* added #include <config.h> to all top-level source files

	* chebyshev.c (gsl_sf_cheb_eval_n): changed local gslMIN and
 	gslMAX to the standard GSL_MIN and GSL_MAX macros

Tue Aug 18 13:36:15 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* coulomb.c (C0sq): changed to using gsl_sf_expm1_impl instead of
 	expm1, since the latter is a GNU extension.

Mon Aug  3 14:43:16 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* bessel_amp_phase.h: undefined consts are now declared extern

Mon Jul 13 12:40:27 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* gamma.c: changed all the factorial functions to take unsigned
 	int arguments, since negative values are not allowed.
	(gsl_sf_choose): fixed off by one error in call to factorial.

Sun Jul 12 13:21:41 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* gsl_sf_legendre.h, gsl_sf_poly.h, gsl_sf_pow_int.h: added
 	HAVE_INLINE around some inline definitions in the header files

	* gamma.c: implemented the natural versions of gsl_sf_lnchoose and
	gsl_sf_choose.

Wed Apr 15 21:27:48 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* added the return code as the second argument of GSL_WARNING, so
 	we can filter on the error number or output a standard message for
 	each one.

1998-02-02  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.am (include_HEADERS): added gsl_specfunc.h so it gets
	into the distribution.
	(INCLUDES): added -I$(top_srcdir) so that bessel.c can find
	gsl_math.h
