	* evolve.c (gsl_odeiv_evolve_apply): report error if step
 	direction does not match interval direction

	* cstd.c (std_control_hadjust): allow for negative step-sizes

	* evolve.c (gsl_odeiv_evolve_apply): allow for integrating
 	backwards in time

Sat Sep 29 21:02:36 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* bsimp.c: use the condition |D^-1 Delta| >> 1 to detect
 	singularities, as described in the paper and implemented in METAN1
 	by Deuflhard et al.

	* evolve.c (gsl_odeiv_evolve_apply): reset the final_step flag
 	whenever the step size is decreased

Sun Jul  1 22:42:02 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* bsimp.c: modified to use new-style vector views

Fri Jun 22 11:59:24 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* evolve.c: keep track of failed step count

Tue Jun 12 11:34:23 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* rkf45.c: added Runge-Kutta Fehlberg method, RKF45

	* reorganized to use standard gsl conventions

Mon Apr 23 10:26:22 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* unified error handling conventions to _e for error handling
 	functions and no suffix for plain functions, so _impl functions
 	are no longer needed.

	* removed tests for EFAULT, since EFAULT should only apply to
 	invalid non-null pointers.

2000-05-14  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Makefile.am (test_LDADD): put libgslpermutation ahead of
	libgslvector in the link beccause the former uses
	`gsl_check_range' which is defined in the latter.

Tue Apr 11 19:59:01 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* bsimp.c (bsimp_step_local): changed gsl_la prefix to gsl_linalg,
 	new naming convention
	

Fri Oct  1 15:46:13 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* bsimp.c: converted to use new-style block/vector code
