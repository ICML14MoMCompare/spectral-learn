* What is new is gsl-1.0:

** First general release.

** Increased the maximum number of iterations in gsl_poly_complex_solve()
from 30 to 60.

* What was new in gsl-0.9.4:

** Reorganized the multmin functions to use the same interface as the
other iterative solvers.

** Added histogram _alloc functions for consistency, in addition to the
existing _calloc functions.

** Renamed all the gsl_multimin functions to be consistent with the
rest of the library.  An underscore has been removed from _minimizer
in all the function names.

** Renamed the function gsl_sf_coulomb_CL_list to gsl_sf_coulomb_CL_array

** A bug in the multimin functions where the function parameters
(params) were omitted has been fixed.

** A bug in the nonlinear minimization routines has been fixed, which
could prevent the algorithms from converging.  Additional tests from
the NIST reference datasets have been added and these now agree with
MINPACK.

** All the physical constants and conversion factors are now defined as
real numbers to avoid potential problems with integer arithmetic.

** The ODE evolution routines now allow for negative step sizes, and
integrating backwards as well as forwards.

** The implicit Burlisch-Stoer ODE algorithm 'bsimp' now detects
singularities and forces a reduction in step size, preventing runaway
instabilities.

** Fixed a bug in the ODE evolution function gsl_odeiv_evolve_apply
which could cause an erroneous value to be returned if the step size
is reduced on the last step.

* What was new in gsl-0.9.3:

** Routines for complex LU decomposition are now available, allowing
the solution of systems of equations with complex coefficients.

** The static versions of inline functions can now be hidden by
defining the preprocessor macro HIDE_INLINE_STATIC.  This is needed
for some compilers.

C++, and a bug in the config.h file for the finite() function has been
fixed.

** Redundant entries in the test suite for the complex math functions
have been removed, making the distribution size smaller.

** Installed programs gsl-randist and gsl-histogram now use shared
libraries.

* What was new in gsl-0.9.1:

** The single precision ffts now uses float throughout, rather than
mixing float and double.

separate from wavetables to eliminate unnecessary recomputation of
trigonometric factors.

** The gsl_interval type has been eliminated and replaced by two double
arguments for simplicity.

logical, with function values assocatied with x-values.

** Modified initialization of vector and matrix views to work with the
SunPro compiler.

** Renamed gsl_Efunc_t to gsl_siman_Efunc_t, in accordance with
namespace conventions.

** Improved accuracy and fixed bugs in gsl_sf_hyperg_1F1,
gsl_sf_bessel_I0_scaled, gsl_sf_erfc, gsl_sf_log_erfc,
gsl_sf_legendre_Q0 and gsl_sf_legendre_Q1, and gsl_sf_zeta.

** Improved IEEE compliance of special functions, overflows now return
Inf and domain errors return NaN.

** Improved checking for underflows in special functions when using
extended precision registers

* What was new in gsl-0.9:

** There is a new system of vector and matrix views.  Any code using
vector and matrix views will need to be updated.  

** The order of arguments of the view functions involving strides have
been changed to be consistent with the rest of the library.

** The ode solvers have been reorganized.

** There are new eigensystem routines for real symmetric and complex

Golub-Reinsch algorithms in addition to the Jacobi algorithm.

** The interpolation directory has been reorganized and a higher-level
"spline" interface has been added which simplifies the handling of
interpolation arguments.

** IEEE support is now available on OpenBSD.

* What was new in gsl-0.8:

** The build process now uses the latest libtool and automake.

** The library should now compile with Microsoft Visual C++.

** Portable versions of the isinf, isnan and finite functions are
available as gsl_isinf(x), gsl_isnan(x) and gsl_finite(x).

** The definitions of GSL_POSINF, GSL_NEGINF and GSL_NAN no longer
cause divisions by zero during compilation.

** The gsl_interp_obj has been renamed to gsl_interp.

** The poly_eval and pow_int functions have been moved from the
specfunc directory to the poly and sys directories.

** The Chebyshev functions are now available as an independent module
in their own directory.

** The error handling conventions have been unified across the
library.  This simplifies the use of the special functions.

** A full CBLAS implementation is now included for systems where ATLAS
has not been installed. The CBLAS library can also be used
independently of GSL.  The organisation of the BLAS directories has been
simplified.

** IEEE support for HPUX-11, NetBSD, Apple Darwin and OS/2 are now
included.

** The library now includes implementations of log1p, expm1, hypot,
acosh, asinh, atanh for platforms which do not provide them.

** The convention for alloc and set functions has changed so that they
are orthogonal. After allocating an object it is now necessary to
initialize it.

** There is a new module for estimating numerical derivatives of functions

** There is a new module for handling data with ntuples

** The histogram lookup functions are now optimized for the case of
uniform bins, and include an inline binary search for speed.

precomputed in a table for efficiency, rather than being computed on
the fly.

** There are several new sorting functions for selecting the k-th
smallest or largest elements of a dataset.

gsl_permutation_next and gsl_permutation_prev.

** The function gsl_complex_xy has been renamed gsl_complex_rect

** The API for simulated annealing has been changed to support search
spaces in which the points cannot be represented as contiguous-memory
data structures.  gsl_siman_solve() now takes three extra arguments: a
copy constructor, a copy function and a destructor, allowing
gsl_siman_solve() to do its work with linked data structures.  If all
three of these function pointers are NULL, then the traditioanl
approach of using malloc(), memcpy(), and free() with the element size
is used.

* What was new in gsl-0.7:

** Linux/PowerPC should now be well supported.

** Header files for common physical constants have been added.

** Functions linear and nonlinear regression in one or more dimensions
are now available.

** There is a new library for generating low-discrepancy quasi-random
sequences.

** The seeding procedure of the default random number generator
MT19937 has been updated to match the 10/99 release of the original
code.  This fixes a weakness which occurred for seeds which were
powers of 2.

** The blas library libgslblasnative has been renamed libgslblas to avoid
confusion with system blas library

* What was new in gsl-0.6:

** The library is now installed as a single shared or static libgsl
file using libtool.

gsl/ subdirectory.

** The header files now use extern "C" to allow them to be included in
C++ programs

** For consistency the following functions have been renamed,

and the vector/matrix view allocation functions have been simplified.

** A new sort directory has been added for sorting objects and vectors.

** A permutation directory has been added for manipulating permutations

** Statistics functions now support a stride argument for generality, and
also support weighted samples and a covariance function.

** The names of the statistics functions have been reorganized for
improved clarity. Consult manual for details.

** The environment variable GSL_IEEE_MODE now uses "," as a separator
instead of ";"

** The autogen.sh script, mostly for use by developers who use the CVS
repository, now does not run configure.

** The histogram directory now has additional functions for copying
and comparing histograms, performing arithmetic on histograms and
finding maximum and minimum values. Corresponding functions have been
added for vectors and matrices.

** The linear algebra directory supports additional methods, including
rectangular QR, rectangular QRPT and Cholesky decomposition.

** Complex arithmetic (+,-,*,/) and complex elementary functions
(sqrt, log, exp, sin, cos, tan, arcsin, arccos, arctan, sinh, cosh,
tanh, arcsinh, arccosh, arctanh) are now supported.

** Multidimensional minimization methods are now available.

** The special functions directory now includes a routine for
computing the value of the incomplete beta function.

* Was new in gsl-0.5:

** There is now a KNOWN-PROBLEMS file which lists compilation problems
and test failures which are known to the developers.

** Many improvements have been made to the special functions directory.

** The extrapolations from the Levin u-transform are now more reliable.

** Linear algebra and Eigensystem routines are now available.

** ODE solvers are now available.

** Multidimensional root finding algorithms are available.

** Minimization now keeps track of function values.

** Matrices and vectors now use a BLAS compatible format, and have a
separate memory handling layer (gsl_block).

** Roots of general polynomials can now be found using gsl_poly_complex_solve

** IEEE modes support on Sparclinux, Tru64, AIX and IRIX

** We have added the second generation RANLUX generators RANLXS and RANLXD

** Minimization algorithms are available (one-dimensional)

** Documentation now works out of the box with the standard Texinfo.

** Full reimplementation of the QUADPACK integration library

** Introduced THANKS file.
We appreciate all patches from people on the net, even those which are
too small to warrant adding the author to the AUTHORS file.  The
THANKS file should include everyone who sent in patches.  They should
also be mentioned in the ChangeLog entry.

* What was new in gsl-0.4.1:

** Two changes not making their way into the documentation
A couple of things are not getting into the docs, so here are the
errata:
*** The FFT routines now take a stride parameter.  Passing 1 for the
stride will make them behave as documented.
*** The complex numbers are now an opaque type, and no assumptions can
be made about the format in which they are stored (they are not stored
as a simple structure anymore, since that is not portable).  The type
is now gsl_complex (or gsl_complex_long_double or gsl_complex_float),
and the macros to access them are
    GSL_REAL(z)
    GSL_IMAG(z)
    GSL_COMPLEX_P_REAL(zp)
    GSL_COMPLEX_P_IMAG(zp)
    GSL_COMPLEX_EQ(z1,z2)
    GSL_SET_COMPLEX(zp,x,y)
    GSL_SET_REAL(zp,x)
    GSL_SET_IMAG(zp,y)

This change in the complex number API makes it important that you
start working with 0.4.1 or later.

** 0.4.1 is being released in occasion of the Red Hat 6.0 release.
The specfunc module is still in an alpha state; if you run "make
check" in the specfunc directory you will see that some tests still
fail.

** Most Alpha specific problems have been fixed. In particular the
random number generators rand48 and ranf now work on the Alpha

** Additional random number distributions: 
   Rayleigh distribution
   n-dimensional spherical distribution 
     (ie, points at random on an n-dimensional sphere)
   Gaussian tail distribution 
     (ie, choosing values from a gaussian distribution subject to a 
      constraint that they be larger than some fixed value, eg 5 sigmas)
   Walker's algorithm for arbitrary discrete distributions

* What was new in gsl-0.4:

** A single libgsl.a file is built in the top level directory and
installed, instead of separate .a files for each subdirectory.

** The parts of the complex struct gsl_complex, .real and .imag, are
not supported anymore. The macros GSL_REAL(z) and GSL_IMAG(z) do the
same job. All complex numbers are considered as packed arrays of
floating point numbers, for portability since the layout of structs or
arrays of structs is not guaranteed.

** The interface for matrices and vectors has changed. Vectors now
support strides, and can be used to access rows and columns of a
matrix. Many more types are available (float, double, long double,
int, long, short, char, signed and unsigned, plus complex floats,
doubles and long doubles) due to improvements in our preprocessor
template system.

** The random number generators have a completely new thread-safe
interface and have moved from the random directory to the rng
directory. Any program using random numbers will have to be
updated. You can also choose generators and seeds using the
environment variables GSL_RNG_TYPE and GSL_RNG_SEED.

** Some additional random number distributions have been added in the
randist directory. The available distributiosn are: bernoulli, beta,
binomial, cauchy, chisq, erlang, exponential, fdist, flat, gamma,
gauss, geometric, levy, logistic, lognormal, nbinomial, pareto,
poisson, sphere, tdist, twosidedexp, weibull.

** The FFT interface has be extended to support strides, but the
implementation hasn't been finished for all the cases yet, The FFT
allocation functions now return a pointer to a newly allocated
wavetable struct, instead of taking the pointer to an existing struct
as an argument.

   e.g. status = gsl_fft_wavetable_alloc(n, w)
   is now    w = gsl_fft_wavetable_alloc(n) in accordance with usual practice

** The statistics directory now works with all the builtin
types. It has a new function for computing the lag1-autocorrelation and
an extra set of numerical accuracy tests from NIST as part of 'make
check'.

** The simulated annealing routines no longer set the random number
seed with the time of day.  You'll need to reseed the generator
yourself if you want subsequent runs to use different random numbers.

** Work is in progress on a reimplementation of QUADPACK in the
`integration' subdirectory, but it is not finished yet.

** Work is in progress on reimplementations of the VEGAS and
MISER Monte Carlo algorithms in the monte' subdirectory.  They work
just fine, but the code is still evolving.

** Work has started on a portable blas system in the `blas'
subdirectory.

** You can now set the IEEE arithmetic mode for your programs from the
environment variable GSL_IEEE_MODE by calling the function
gsl_ieee_env_setup(). Currently this only works with the Linux kernel,
HP-UX, SunOS4 and Solaris.

** There are some simple spline interpolation functions in the `interp'
subdir.

** The NEWS file now uses outline mode, like the Emacs NEWS file


* This covers changes made *after* the gsl-0.2 snapshot

** Added several new modules: histogram, integration, matrix, specfunc
and vectors.

** Changed libgsl_statisctics.a to libgslstatistics.a and
libgsl_siman.a to libgslsiman.a, since most of the packages don't have
the underscore.  Users will have to remove the old files, unless they
do a "make uninstall" on the previous release before they install this
new one.

** Changes to the random number suite
Incorporated the gauss, poisson and exponential distributions in
the standard libgslrandom.a
